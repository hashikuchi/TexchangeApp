<h1>Scandit SDK 4.10</h1>

<h2>New Features/Performance Improvements</h2>

<ul>

The pitch and skew (yaw) tolerance increased to up to 70 degrees (for QR codes of version 1 (without 4th alignment pattern) and version 2 and higher (with 4th alignment pattern) - this is an increase of ~50% over SDK version 4.8. We also improved the maximum decode range and robustness of the QR decoder for a much improved QR code scanning user experience (see the video on our web page for details).</li>
<li>Scandit&#8217;s unique blurry decoding now decodes 1D barcodes before the autofocus has kicked in on additional popular Samsung devices such as the Galaxy S4 and S6. The impact is that the time to scan a barcode is drastically reduced on these devices as well. </li>
